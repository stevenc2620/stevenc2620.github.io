During the week we used wescheme.org to re-create the flags we've chosen. Using the knowledge we've acquired from previous work we've done in wescheme.org, we created our flags. I chose to do the England flag. I chose it since it was good practice for me to work on the skills I've acquired. Once I was done I decide to do another flag which was the flag of France. It was a bit harder for the fact that I needed to be accurate wtih the length of the colors. Overall, creating the flags helped me a lot develop my skills a lot more.
