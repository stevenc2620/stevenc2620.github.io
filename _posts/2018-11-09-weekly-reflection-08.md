This week we designed functions. We wrote the contratcs, examples, and definitions of a problem given to us. It provided help to us because we was able to understand how to define a function so we won't have to write the whole example and use the definition has a shortcut. Another thing we leanred was about structure. For example today, we was given an instruction of an image to produce and later write the contract, emaples, and definition.
