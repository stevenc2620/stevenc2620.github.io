This week we designed functions. We wrote the contratcs, examples, and definitions of a problem given to us. It provided help to us because we was able to understand how to define a function so we won't have to write the whole example and use the definition has a shortcut. Another thing we leanred was about structure. For example today, we was given an instruction of an image to produce and later write the contract, emaples, and definition. An example, of our work was that we had to get the contract, example, and define it. One of it was to create a function for gt where it creates a solid, green triangle with a given size. An example I used was ```(Example (gt s) (triangle s "solid" "green))```. What it does is that I would now be able to change the size to any size I want while keeping it a solid colored green triangle.
