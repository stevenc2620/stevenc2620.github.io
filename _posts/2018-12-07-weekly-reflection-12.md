In this week, we were given a flag to work on depending on where we was seated. I was given the Sweeden flag. The ration of the total height and total width is 16:10. I used centimeters to measure the measurments of each of the parts in my flag. I tried to accurately measure each of the parts. After, glue each part to the correct place. Each of the parts also had a ratio of how much space it should take. For example, the width had a ratio of 5:2:9. Meaning that the rectangles had a width of either 5, 2, or 9 units, in my case cm. The height ha da ration of 4:2:4, it was a bit more even since two pieces have the same height. 

There were some challenges. Like I tried to accurately measure every single part of my flag then glue it. But I could have done a abse first with all the measurements of 16 cm width and 10cm height. If I had the base it fixed four rectangles and had them ready and I wouldn't go to all the trouble in doing them seperately. After I would on have two yellow stripes to accurately make. The first time I messed up trying to creat ethem accurately, but for next time I can just layer over to make life easier.
