We took a midterm test on what we have leanred so far in computer science. The questions were based on the mastery skills we have learned like using tools, applying tools, and comparing functions to real life situations. Question 7 had a proportion correct of 86%. Meaning that 86% of the total students that took the test answered it correctly. Question 7 asked which function matched the contract. The contract given was ```; show-score : String number String Number -> Image ```. This contract would show the score of two different teams given the name and score. 

The choices were: 
(a) (show-score "Red Sox" "Cardinals" 5 5)
(b) (show-score "Red Sox" 6 "Cardinals" 4)
(c) (pick-flavor "vanilla" "oreo" "mint") 
(d) (pick-flavor "lemon" "lime") 

The 86% chose b. This is because the contract is the outline for a function. All that's done is input the variables. Choice b follows the contract because "Red Sox" and "Cardinals" are both strings and the 6 and 5 are numbers. In the contract the number goes after the string and choice b does the same. Choice a puts two strings then the numebrs after the two strings in which is incorrect. Choice c and d have a different name, instead of the name of the function being show-score it's pick-flavor, and so those two are incorrect.

Question 7 was a questions about mastery skill 1 and considered an apprentice level question. This is because the quetion has been seen before. Seeing it before means that students have knowledge of the question, on what it asks. As well as, it's applying a contratc with a function.
