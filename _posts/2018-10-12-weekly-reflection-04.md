This week in computer science we learned about definitions. Using our knowledge on functions we used wescheme.org to put an image inside the image with the example of (put image (circle 25 "solid" "blue") 40 5 (square 50 "soldi" "red")). The example created a red square with a blue circle in the bottom right corner. We did the work of defintions with a partner.

In this week I learned, how to place an image inside another image in the positions I want it to be in. Also, I experineced for my first time a pair programming and the roles a pair would have. For me it was helpful since it was two people working on one problem and mistakes can be checked a lot more.
