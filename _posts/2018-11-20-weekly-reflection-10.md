![Screenshot](/images/SCREENSHOT.png)

Inside WeScheme.org I went inside a starter File called Define Values. The file gave me an outline or a preview of what is expected of me to do for my own game. It helped me by giving me an example of inputting images for the PLAYER and the BACKGROUND. The example was ```(define PLAYER (bitmap/url "image url"))``` this example allowed me to copy an image link and input it to the example for the background and player in order to use images from the internet to create my own gmae. What I had to do was think of what I wanted my PLAYER, BACKGROUND, TARGET, and DANGER would be. Once I knew what they were going to be I copied their image link and replaced the old link with the image link I wanted. One thing I had to change was the example of the danger and target to an example that will allow me to input an image link. 

After having the characters I wanted in my game. Using the SCREENSHOT example it helped me visualize it looked liked because the value screenshot put the player, danger, target, and the background together. Seeing the screenshot I was able to determine how to scale the image. I worked on scaling the characters to a way that I thought it would look best and would fit.
