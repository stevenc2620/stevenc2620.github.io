## Flag of _Sweeden_ by _Steven C._

## Describe your program

The country's flag I worked on was the flag of Sweeden. 

I probably would expect a 3 as a grade because I showed effort in writing a funciton that would change because of one thing. Also, because my flag is scaleable where the ratio of the stripes and the rest of my flag is placed accurately.
