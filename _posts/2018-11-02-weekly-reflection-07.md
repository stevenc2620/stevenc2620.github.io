In this week we learned and worked on function definitons. We used functions that we already know and defined them. Except we added what we was changing to the name so it connects to the function and we're able to change what we want without re-writing the whole function over and over. An example of a function we used to work on was ```(define (gt size)(triangle size "solid" "green"))```. This function allows us to change the size of the triangle to any size we want only by inputting a size we want, while remaing to be a green triangle. We continued the worked by using contracts we know or from the homework sheet. It has helped me learn a new way of defining functions without have to do the same thing for every signle time we wnat to change something.
