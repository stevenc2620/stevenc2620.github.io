In this week we learned and worked on function definitons. We used functions that we already know and defined them. Except we added what we was changing to the name so it connects to the function and we're able to change what we want without re-writing the whole function over and over. An example of a function we used to work on was ```(define (gt size)(triangle size "solid" "green"))```. We continued the worked by using contracts we know or from the homework sheet. Another way to define a contract is to think of it as an outline.
