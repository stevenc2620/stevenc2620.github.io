In this 1/3 of our semester a lot has been accomplished. The first thing that we learned was about HTML, Markup language, CSS, etc. This was in order to help us create our github webpage for our blog. We learned how each one works and what it does in programming. For example, CSS is the style and affects the way the webpage looks. Using this knowledge we created our webpage and then weekly blogs about our reflection of the week in computer science class. 

After, we got into wescheme.org helping use comprehend the racket language. It helped us find the answers to example expressions that we were given. We later used it for contracts such as (circle 50 "solid" "red") to tell it what we want in return to be given what we expect it to give us. We practiced using the contracts to create shapes. Also, definitions in which it helped us give values to the things we wanted and just type in the name of the defintion insteaad of writng the whole program. With the help of the contracts we created shapes over shapes and even made flags we chose. Now, we're moving on to our video game which sounds hard, but fun at the same time. We started by adding an image for our background, player, target, and danger.
