This week in computer science I learned more about the racket language using wescheme. Also, we tried using the racket langauge to create images using an example like (shape  number "string" "string"). Another thing was that we drew a flag we wanted and we'll learn how to recreate it in weshceme. Lastly, I sort of learned how to apply css coolor using the help of websites and getting color from palletes of other webistes.
